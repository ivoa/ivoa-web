This is the technical section, for people interested in building VO services, deploying VO infrastructure at their data centre, writing applications and web pages that "speak VO", or simply those wishing to know more technical detail about how the VO works, and how IVOA standards are put together. (If you are an astronomer simply wishing to use VO services and tools, go to the Astronomers section).
