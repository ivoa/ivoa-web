The Virtual Observatory (VO) is the vision that astronomical datasets and other
resources should work as a seamless whole. Many projects and data centres
worldwide are working towards this goal. The International Virtual Observatory
Alliance (IVOA) is an organisation that debates and agrees the technical
standards that are needed to make the VO possible. It also acts as a focus for
VO aspirations, a framework for discussing and sharing VO ideas and technology,
and body for promoting and publicising the VO.

To learn more about the IVOA as an organisation, read the
"[About](about/)" section.

To learn more about the VO from a user's point of view, including how to find VO
tools and services, read the "[Astronomers](astronomers/)" section. There
is also a page about the [VO for students and the public](astronomers/vo_for_public/).

To learn how to publish VO services, or write VO-compatible software, start by
reading the "[Deployers/Developers](deployers/)" section.

Internal IVOA discussions are publicly viewable in the "[Members](members)"
section.
