The Virtual Observatory (VO) is an international research data infrastructure
in Astronomy and Astrophysics.  Spelled out, this means it

* defines [standards](/documents/) for finding, accessing, using, and
  describing data ranging from catalogues to images to cubes to complex
  datasets packaging measurements, calibrators, simulation data, derived
  data products or whatever else is necessary for research at the limits of the
  instruments.

* brings together about 50 data centres worldwide adhering to these standards,
  which includes many major players like the CDS, NASA, ESA, CADC, and many
  others.

* joins the efforts of the authors of client software, libraries,
  educational material, web portals, or science platforms, which all
  cooperate to make data-intensive research in astronomy a pleasure.
  Or, well, at least possible.

In 2025, this translates into some 30'000 “resources” (ranging from a
catalogue of a few entries to huge data collections like, say, the
CADC's data holdings), which serve hundreds of millions of data sets
(e.g., images or spectra) and hundreds of billions of catalogue entries.

Most of the resources are immediately accessible for anyone.  To learn
how to do that, have a look at what
[Tools](/astronomers/applications) have VO support built in or how to
do your [first steps](/astronomers/using_the_vo).

To build and maintain the VO, in the early 2000s several research
organisations formed the [International Virtual Observatory
Alliance](/about/what_is_vo) (IVOA), which debates and agrees the
technical standards that are needed to make the VO possible.  If you
have suggestions for how to evolve the VO or provide other input, your
first contact should be the [member
organisation](/about/member_organizations) next to you.  But your input
is also welcome directly with the [IVOA's Working and Interest
Groups](/members/working-groups).
